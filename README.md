Description: 

An Image "filter" is applied to images. Run in the command line, this java-based application prompts the user to enter the name of the image to blur as well as the size of the window used (odd number only).The window refers to the size of the square that incorporates the pixels that will be used in the blurring process. The mean/median RGB of the surrounding pixels is used to replace the current pixel RBG. This is done through a serial and parallel method, with a timer in order to assess performance.
Although unusual, a Makefile is used to compile these Java files.
